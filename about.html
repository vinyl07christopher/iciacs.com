        The International Conference on Innovations and Advances in Cognitive Systems will be held on --- CONFERENCE DATE---- at ---COLLEGE NAME-----.

        Cognitive engineering is a relatively new discipline that gains a significant research attraction in this age of big data and Artificial
        Intelligence (AI). Cognitive systems are human-centred systems that supports and mimic human cognitive abilities such as decision-making,
        reasoning and problem-solving. Cognitive systems are now considered as a primary source for enabling cognitive interaction between humans and
        IT-based systems. ICIACS 2024 is an international conference initiated with a research theme “Computational Intelligence and Next-Generation
        Cognitive Systems”. This conference intends to enable a research discussion on the implementation of various computational intelligence
        methods, such as multi-task learning, transfer learning, deep learning, etc. to address the variety of challenges confronting the cognitive
        systems. ICIACS 2024 aims to showcase the concepts, principles, frameworks, processes and models of different cognition-related domains such
        as cognitive systems, information science, human-computer interaction, cybersecurity, automation etc. In addition, this conference emphasizes
        on the design and optimization of human users in cognitive systems since system thinking serves as a foundation for cognitive engineering.
        Also, research contributions are also welcome on the real-time applications of cognitive systems in terms of productivity, security, safety,
        and automation.
